- God of creation
- The remaining flames from Ignis' creation formed into the ice-blue [[Lumen\|Lumen]]. This lumen eventually formed the gods of the [[Myrian Civilization\|Myrian Civilization]]

- Source of [[Lumen\|lumen]]
- Resting place of all life.
- [[Myria Helius\|Helius]] attempted to generate infinite [[Lumen\|lumen]] by feeding caves into [[Myria Ignis\|Ignis]].
