This disease commonly manifests among [[Changers\|Changers]] who have made extensive use of their abilities. While it can also appear in other non-Changers, it's much rarer. There have been links to it appearing on the victims of Changers, as well as some [[Seeders\|Seeders]].

The disease symptoms appear as a slow inability to hold conscious thoughts for long. This leads to its victims slowly "melting" into unconsciousness. Initially it can appear as mild disorientation, amnesia or the like. Over time it can progress to the point where even motorics are effected as the victims have trouble asserting control over their body. Eventually progression ends with the person in question being reduced to a near comatose shell of themselves.
