## Traits
- Extremely hard working
- Optimistic
- Spiritualistic
- Dedicated to her responsibilities
- Crushed beneath those same responsibilities
## Notes
- Feels compelled to help [[John Mason\|John Mason]]
	- Helping John gives Fei purpose, but she's feels like she can't help him when he's out gathering materials. She worries about him constantly but her own optimistic nature makes her incapable of expressing that worry.
- Doesn't want to be left alone. As such, doesn't want to succeed with the space burials because it means she would have to say goodbye to all of the ghosts that keep her company.
	- Resolved when she realizes she can move forward with John, who will stay by her if she helps him.
- Last remaining witch of the [[Earthology\|Earthology]] church in [[Rocket of Whispers\|Rocket of Whispers]].
## Arcs
Fei's arc is about the responsibilities she's saddled with by the witches of the Earthology church. When she wakes up, her only goal is to "return us". That's nebulous in concept. It could mean "bring back the witches", but it could also mean "return us to the stars". This leads to her looking for a way to perform a [[Space Burial\|Space Burial]] and as a result leads her to the Opus rocket factory, and [[John Mason\|John Mason]]. Meeting John gives Fei a concrete purpose -- if she can launch a space burial successfully, she can help John deal with his [[ghosts\|ghosts]]. 

She tries to stay optimistic for John's sake, but this only antagonizes the main. She doesn't understand that he grew up with empty promises, brought on by this parents failing to come home after leaving to find parts for space burials. She sees herself as chronically incapable of being a witch, so each of the failed rocket launches fuel that view of herself, and in turn makes her feel like she's letting John down. She feels like she can't do anything for John but stay in the factory and work on the rocket, and more importantly worry about him the entire time. Even when John is downed due to injuries she keeps bringing him back because she's always thinking about him. It tears her apart to send him out into danger constantly. When John directly calls her out for this, it rips her apart. For the first time she takes an active role in the collection of parts, and heads to the church where she initially woke up in.
