## Quotes
> Only the helpless cry.
## Arcs
Jun's clan, the Lee clan, are born from peasants and were the main part of [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] that took part in the [[Lumen War\|Lumen War]]. Unfortunately they were also the first target of [[United Mining\|United Mining]] after the [[Ring Liberation Front\|Ring Liberation Front]] was nearly annihilated by the [[Witch\|Witch]] fleet. Forced to abandon the war, the clan barely scraped by with the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s they had secured for themselves.

Jun, one of many sons, is taught from a young age to protect people so that they don't have to cry. It's this ideal that bought him the loyalty of [[Kay Volans\|Kay Volans]]. Kay begins to mentor Jun, and eventually Jun rises within the clan, becoming the designated heir. He performs for the emperor of [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]], and it's here that disaster strikes. He questions the emperor's ruling, and in doing so gives him an excuse to shame the Lee clan, taking their remaining [[Lumen Caves\|lumen caves]] for himself. Kay spirits Jun away within their ship, Khun, going against the wishes of the clan leader in the process. They flee to [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]].
