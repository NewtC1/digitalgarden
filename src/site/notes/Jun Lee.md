## Quotes
> Only the helpless cry.
## Arcs
Jun's clan, the Lee clan, are born from peasants and were the main part of [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] that took part in the [[Lumen War\|Lumen War]]. Unfortunately they were also the first target of [[United Mining\|United Mining]] after the [[Ring Liberation Front\|Ring Liberation Front]] was nearly annihilated by the [[Witch\|Witch]] fleet. Forced to abandon the war, the clan barely scraped by with the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s they had secured for themselves.

Jun, one of many sons, is taught from a young age to protect people so that they don't have to cry. It's this ideal that bought him the loyalty of [[Kay Volans\|Kay Volans]]. Kay begins to mentor Jun, and eventually Jun rises within the clan, becoming the designated heir. He performs for the emperor of [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]], and it's here that disaster strikes. He questions the emperor's ruling, and in doing so gives him an excuse to shame the Lee clan, taking their remaining [[Lumen Caves\|lumen caves]] for himself. Kay spirits Jun away within their ship, Khun, going against the wishes of the clan leader in the process. They flee to [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]].

Attempting to save [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] from the [[Bones Brigade\|Bones Brigade]] results in [[Kay Volans\|Kay]] getting shot. As a result, [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] attempts to harvest a rare lumen flower from another [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]. [[Kay Volans\|Kay]] notices a secret message left by an [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] assassin sent to kill Jun and stays behind. Jun makes it back to Kay when he realizes something is wrong, but is unable to prevent his death. Kay dies, reminding Jun of all of the various promises he made.

Kay's death marks a very big point for Jun. As his surrogate father, Kay's final words mean a lot to the guy. Where Jun was very eager to prove himself before this point, his failure to protect his mentor tempers him. He's in a really bad place after Kay's death, and when [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] offered him a place aboard [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], he gladly takes it. However, he only does so after [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] assures him that if he never stops searching for [[Lumen\|lumen]], he will always be close to his mentor.

From this point on [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] acts as a stable rock for Eda, and even promises to help her find Red Grant. He himself barely changes after this point, and is the most dependable and humble member of the [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] crew.
