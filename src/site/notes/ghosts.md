#OPUS #RocketOfWhispers 
Ghosts are very likely related to [[Lumen\|Lumen]] in [[Echo of Starsong\|Echo of Starsong]]. They appear to be leftover memories of people who died without receiving any form of closure. [[Earthology\|Earthology]] preaches that for a ghost to pass on, a [[Space Burial\|Space Burial]] must be held.

Ghosts say different things depending on the location. The townsfolk ghosts are gentle and caring. The ones in the mine are lamenting about the mine explosion. The ones near the town are full of desperation to find their loved ones as the plague progressed.
