OPUS is a collection of video games built around the shared OPUS universe. The games primarily focus on how people honor the wishes of those who have come before them, whether that be the dead, the missing, or those simply long in the past. They also take place thousands of years apart and occur in reverse order chronologically, meaning each game happened before the previous one.
