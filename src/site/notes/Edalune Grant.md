## Arcs
Eda's story starts as that of a prodigy. She managed to make it all the way to level 5 within the [[Myrian Witching Tower\|Myrian Witching Tower]], but when her voice started to fail she was demoted back down to level 4. When she tried to return to the upper levels to see her friends, she meets [[Red Grant\|Red Grant]]. Red immediately sees that [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] is trying to become a witch so she doesn't have to be alone, and tries to steer her away from that path, claiming that if she followed it she would become just another weapon of war. She starts to teach Eda outside of the [[Myrian Witching Tower\|Myrian Witching Tower]], specifically "teaching her how to be a new age witch". When Eda regains her ability to sing, she tries to return to the Witching Tower once more. By this point the [[Lumen War\|Lumen War]] has ended, and along with it the reputation of the Witching Tower. 

By this point Eda has a problem with identity. She has trouble identifying as anything other than a witch, and in meeting [[Red Grant\|Red Grant]] tries to become like her. What she doesn't understand is that [[Red Grant\|Red Grant]] sees herself as a relic of the [[Lumen War\|Lumen War]], and doesn't want Eda to become like her. To many people who fought in that war, they are still fighting. Red wants to pass on her teachings to Eda so that she can become herself, not another copy of Red.

When [[United Mining\|United Mining]] approaches Eda to assist in the first [[Banshee\|Banshee]] expedition, [[Red Grant\|Red]] takes her place. This prompts Eda to believe that she's once again being abandoned by [[Red Grant\|Red]]. She doesn't understand that Red is trying to give her a chance to live her own life. This also instills a deep dislike of people protecting her, because to her it means those people will disappear and abandon her again. This shows up later when [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] tries to protect her at the [[Lumen Ziggurat\|Lumen Ziggurat]].

Years later, she meets [[Jun Lee\|Jun]]. By now she has grown in confidence, and in trying to emulate [[Red Grant\|Red]] she actually appears to have her shit together. She remains largely the same for most of the story, but two things always affect her: people bad-mouthing witches, and people bringing up [[Red Grant\|Red Grant]] specifically. As both of these are now core to the identity she's wearing, she reacts badly when they're brought up.

Through most of [[Echo of Starsong\|Echo of Starsong]], Eda is constantly doubting her abilities as a witch. Part of that is because of conversations with [[Doctor Rushell\|Doctor Rushell]], but it's also because she never became a full witch within the [[Myrian Witching Tower\|Myrian Witching Tower]]. It's that doubt that makes her second guess herself, and it's consistent through all of the game.
