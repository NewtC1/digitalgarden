### Arc
Bet you weren't expecting a Bones arc.

Bones is mostly notable because he represents the dregs of the war. As both a war hero and the leader of the [[Bones Brigade\|Bones Brigade]], he shows a lot of the leftover pain the losers of the war feel. He used to be a high up member of the [[Ring Liberation Front\|Ring Liberation Front]], which was crushed by the [[Myrian Witching Tower\|Myrian Witching Tower]] during the war. It's because of that that most of the Peakers hate the [[Witch\|Witch]]es, and [[United Mining\|United Mining]]'s slander doesn't help. However, Bones also hates [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] a ton for abandoning him and his men during the war. This is why he has a special spot in his heart for [[Jun Lee\|Jun]]. When Jun offers to help him after the [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] assassin killed all his men, he turned him down. To him, accepting help from Jun was a betrayal of his men's ideals. More than that though, he wanted to die.

Bones' darkest moment is here, just after the death of his men. He is simultaneously betraying himself, living up to him, and betraying them all at once. He hands his fate to Jun, and Jun simply refuses to take it. He walks away, leaving Bones to find a new path for himself, away from the glory days as a war here. Bones survives this. He turns himself in.

Bones will later reappear over the course of the story. He rises through the ranks of [[United Mining\|United Mining]] military, in return for a reduced sentence. It gives him a chance to protect his friend, and apparently that's what Jun eventually becomes to him.
