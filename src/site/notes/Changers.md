Memory mages that can alter existing memories. Changers, like [[Seeders\|Seeders]], work to provide targets with new memories but do so by deleting or altering existing memories. Because of this they are frequently seen as a sledgehammer and can really screw with a target's mind. The downside to this is that they have trouble remembering *how* they changed a memory, whereas [[Seeders\|Seeders]] still have full memory of whatever seeds they plant. Changes applied through this magic are short term, and generally lack the creativity seen in a Seeder's work. As a result they tend to be less believable, though memory changes that go against core beliefs will frequently last an extraordinarily short time. Changers are popular as torturers since their power frequently renders it hard to remember what they did or who they did it to.

As a rule Changers tend to be scatterbrained, and this affliction gets worse as they use their power more. This disorder is called [[Melter's Syndrome\|Melter's Syndrome]] and makes it very difficult to hide their capabilities as it progress. The oldest Changers have extreme difficulty holding thoughts for long, and may even lose control of their powers. In the last stages they become a simple shell incapable of holding memories.
