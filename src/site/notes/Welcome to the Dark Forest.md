This is the knowledge repository for every note taken during my time making videos. Please remember that not all notes are published, so not all links will work. However, if you can see this page the majority of the vault should be visible.

Hubs for knowledge include links to [[Universal themes\|Universal themes]] and other areas I've targeted for notes, such as some video topics. [[The Alters Overview\|The Alters]] is the first game I ever committed notes to Obsidian, so topics and scripts before that are listed somewhere on GoogleDocs.
