### Summary
Echo of Starsong follows the story of [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] and [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] as they travel through the [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]] in search of the mysterious [[Lumen Caves\|Lumen Caves]] their civilization needs to fuel their ships. Along the way they uncover the secrets of the ancient [[Myrian Civilization\|Myrian Civilization]], leading them to unlock the secrets of [[Lumen\|Lumen]].
#### Chapter 1
Jun and Kay meet Eda and Remi. After the [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] crew buy some suspicious [[Lumen Caves\|Lumen Caves]] from a [[Capybarian trader\|Capybarian trader]], [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] and [[Kay Volans\|Kay Volans]] race to catch up with [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] to warn them that it's likely a pirate trap. Unfortunately, doing so results in the two getting captured and their ship is seized. [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] is captured along with them. [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] manages to rescue all three, though they do so at the cost [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] and [[Kay Volans\|Kay]]'s ship, [[Khun\|Khun]], which is used as a decoy while they escape. [[Kay Volans\|Kay]] is wounded during the escape, prompting them to seek medical aid for him at the nearby Guifang city.

#### Chapter 2 part 1
While searching for a plant that will help with Kay's recovery, Jun and Kay both head towards a known [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]. After finding a strange [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] medallion on the ground in the cave, [[Kay Volans\|Kay]] sends [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] onwards, saying he'll wait near the ship while Jun continues exploring. As Jun progresses, Kay spouts an increasing number of death flags. It soon becomes obvious why: Kay recognized the medallion and stayed behind to head off an [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] assassin sent after [[Jun Lee\|Jun]]. Tipped off to their location by the bounty placed by [[Bones\|Bones]] after they blew up the previous [[Bones Brigade\|Bones Brigade]] base, he left the medallion as a sign for Kay to betray Jun. Loyal to the end, Kay refused. When Jun realizes something is wrong he makes his way back to Kay. Too late, unfortunately. Kay dies on Jun's shoulder, while reminding him of the promises Jun made to him.

While searching for a way to hold a space burial for [[Kay Volans\|Kay]], the group is directed by [[Benzel\|Benzel]], [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]]'s information broker, towards Silk Oasis. Once they get there they meet [[Lamar\|Lamar]], the local merchant guild head as well as a member of the [[Myria Ignis\|Myria Ignis]] merchant association. When he realizes who the group is, [[Lamar\|Lamar]] agrees to help them if they'll explore a cave for him. Jun begins the exploration only to discover it's a trap set by the [[Bones Brigade\|Bones Brigade]] as revenge. He's about to head back when the [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] assassin catches up. He kills all members of the [[Bones Brigade\|Bones Brigade]], only leaving [[Bones\|Bones]] alive when [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] intervenes. Desperate, [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] overloads the [[Lumen\|lumen]] in the cave before locking the assassin inside. The gave detonates, killing the assassin for good. Left outside with [[Bones\|Bones]], he realizes that Bones formed the [[Bones Brigade\|Bones Brigade]] to provide for his underlings, all of whom are veterans of the [[Lumen War\|Lumen War]]. He takes [[Bones\|Bones]] back to the ship and convinces him to turn himself in.

After the events at the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]], the group confronts [[Lamar\|Lamar]], who reveals that [[Bones\|Bones]] is a hero to him and most other Peakers. Anyone would have turned them in to him. Finally, they are able to send [[Kay Volans\|Kay]]'s body off to [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] to be buried.

Afterwards, Eda asks Jun what he intends to do now that Kay is gone, offering him a place aboard [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]]. Jun is understandably shaken up by the whole experience, and asks her to give him some time to think. It's during this conversation that her voice begins to cut out, and the downsides of using a vocalizer for speech are revealed.
#### Chapter 2 part 2
As the crew make their way to Trash Mountain, Jun begins to come to terms with the loss of [[Kay Volans\|Kay]]. Bones officially withdraws the bounty by the time they've made it to Trash Mountain, leaving little reason for Jun to hide anymore. He finally agrees to join [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] officially. Still uncertain of himself, he throws himself into his work, doing anything and everything he can to make himself useful. The group begins to track down more lumen caves, hoping to find something new. Remi's jealousy mounts in the background.

Their first cave is a bust. Long mined out, nothing can be gained from it. Jun takes a moment to sit next to a contaminated [[Lumen\|Lumen]] pool, triggering memories of the promises he made to Kay when he became the heir to the Lee clan. Becoming lost in the memories, Bones' words return to him. "What kind of messed up family sends people to kill each other, eh?" The seeds of doubt in his clan are planted as Jun finally takes the time to truly grieve for his lost mentor.

After Jun stops responding, Eda ventures into the cave to find him. Waking him from his daze, she tells him about the plants in this cave, which can enhance sensitivity to lumen. Jun asks what that means, and she tells him it can connect memories across time and space. No matter how far apart, the people we know will always remain connected to us in the Lumen. In this way, staying close to Lumen means Kay will always be with Jun. They venture back to the ship together.

Red Chamber's application to join the [[Lumen Association\|Lumen Association]] is once more denied, prompting them to return to Guifang and [[Doctor Rushell\|Doctor Rushell]] to debate their cause. Rushell, forever against Eda's quest to find her master, continues to stand in her way. Jun begins receiving messages from [[Bones\|Bones]] as part of his "rehabilitation" in [[United Mining\|United Mining]] care.

As they head back to Guifang, Jun finally asks Eda why she isn't concerned with her share of the lumen the find. We learn through a flashback of Eda's old master, [[Red Grant\|Red Grant]]. Red's been mentioned before now but never by name, so this is the first time we see Red directly question Eda's desire to be a witch. When asked, Eda claims she wants to be a witch so she can see her friends. Red immediately denies this, saying it's because she doesn't want to be left alone. She then takes Eda as a student, promising to teach her how to be a true witch. Returning to Jun's question, she simply says "I'm looking for lumen, just like you."

When they arrive at Guifang, [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] has a short, but very tense conversation with [[Doctor Rushell\|Doctor Rushell]]. Rushell doesn't agree with how Eda keeps putting her crew in danger as they explore more [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s. She reminds Eda of the death that just occurred, but after a moment calms down. Realizing that Eda won't let this go, she finally gives in. Handing over the military specifications to [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], she abandons the conversation. Her last words are "You don't have what it takes to find her." She also sends the crew some unchecked data on a [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]], saying that it's not been verified by [[United Mining\|United Mining]].

Following the data, [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] gradually moves past the remains of [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]] influence in [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]]. Jun gets a chance to learn about his own history, and they keep finding more lumen caves, all of which has been looted. What they don't expect is to find a mysterious [[Starsong\|Starsong]] that seemingly has no asteroid signal associated with it. Switching to manual controls, they approach it regardless, and discover a colossal space station of Myrian origin. Heading inside, they find it to be a massive shrine to [[The Ten Peaks\|The Ten Peaks]]. 

Stopped by what appears to be a gate, Jun works to amplify the station's [[Starsong\|Starsong]] so Eda can record it. While Jun works, Eda recalls how she was abandoned by the [[Myrian Witching Tower\|Myrian Witching Tower]] and adopted by [[Red Grant\|Red]]. It's here that we learn how Eda got her name and the meaning behind it: It's a flower that was used to treat her voice, and was given to her by [[Red Grant\|Red]] when she was adopted. By now it's becoming obvious why Eda insisted on coming on this run, and why she wants to get through the gate. She believes Red might be behind it.

Once Jun finishes his work, Eda records a new [[Starsong\|Starsong]]. It's here that she notices huge amount of emotions present in the lumen. Handing the resulting Starsong to Jun, Eda finally apologizes for what happened to Kay. Jun simply brushes it off, saying it wasn't her fault, and continues to activate the gate. When the gate doesn't move, Jun realizes it's actually a ship to activate the entire space station, which resembles a giant Synthesceptor. He pushes Eda out of the way of the blast as he's flung out into space.

Lost in the flow of the Lumen consciousness, Jun remembers how Kay once told him that it was because of him that he stayed with the Lee clan. All at once, his role in Kay's death slams into him. Eda catches up to him and manages to pull him back to the station, but Jun is still devastated by his failure to protect Kay. For him, it's a betrayal of the same traits that Kay admired in him, and the surge of lumen amplified that. Eda assures him that, No, he is not useless. Speaking from her own experience, she reminds him that even if he couldn't save Kay, he did save her from Bones. Without him they couldn't have found this station, and they never would have been able to activate it.

Once Jun calms down, Eda finally reveals that she's been searching for lumen caves in hope of finding her master. Because [[United Mining\|United Mining]] was searching for the mysterious [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]] [[Banshee\|Banshee]], they conscripted her knowing that [[Red Grant\|Red]] would take her place. Ever since then, she and Remi have been searching for [[Banshee\|Banshee]] together. She also explains that this is why she hates when people try to protect her, as it only seems to lead to her losing those people.

Noticing the way the [[Lumen\|lumen]] appears as a sea of flowers, Eda is reminded of her home. She tells [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] about the small house she shared with [[Red Grant\|Red]], where the flower fields are always in full bloom, asking if he wants to see them with her. He seems non-committal at first, but then adds "If it's with you, I would love to see it." Thus begins the promise that will keep the two together for the rest of the game.

There's a short interlude during which it's revealed that the discovery of the Lumen Ziggurat elevated the [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] to a new level of fame. This, combined with the rescue of an [[Ironwind\|Ironwind]] immigration convoy, led to them achieving the title of "Honorable Runners". 

#### Chapter 3 part 1
The story begins with a dream from [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]]. In the dream she remembers hearing a song, but when she tries to sing back six lights stare her down and she loses her voice. Her master tells her she might be experiencing memories from the [[Lumen\|lumen]], and in this case she's right. What Eda is experiencing is the last memories of [[Myria Terra\|Terra]] before the Six Peaks of Earth killed her. 

At this point it's revealed that [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] has been turning down requests for at least a month, but that [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] has continued to overwork herself while hunting down more [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s. Jun says it might be time for them to take a break, given that they've thoroughly satisfied his own need to find [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s. During this conversation, Remi finds information on [[Banshee\|Banshee]], and Eda heads off to find out. Jun starts to work on a message back to his clan leader, saying that he might be returning soon. What he doesn't know is that [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] had to hack into his communications to message Eda, so she sees this as well.

They make their to Mount Aurora, where the [[Lumen Association\|Lumen Association]]'s Council of Ten is waiting to brief them. They ask the members of [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] to infiltrate as many [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s as they can before [[United Mining\|United Mining]] does. It seems there is a massive push to claim as many of these caves as possible, with one of the caves possibly being [[Banshee\|Banshee]]. Since this is the only lead they've ever gotten on the possible location of [[Red Grant\|Red Grant]], they accept.

Moving into [[Ironwind\|Ironwind]] territory, [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]]'s relationship with [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] begins to go downhill. Because Remi believes Jun is preparing to leave, she starts taking any opportunity she can to jab at him. Despite this, Jun's faith in Remi remains absolute, causing her to spiral into self-hatred. Eventually she uses a cave run as an opportunity to betray Jun. By withholding information at a crucial time, Jun is captured by [[United Mining\|United Mining]] soldiers. Jun quickly realizes he's been betrayed by Remi, but stays silent as the soldiers begin to rough him up. Surprisingly, their captain is none other than [[Bones\|Bones]], and as soon as he sees [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] he orders his men to let him go. He warns him however that this is likely a one-time thing. He won't be able to help again.

When Jun makes it back to [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], they struggle to figure out how Jun got captured. Remi, in charge of the calculations to avoid the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] expedition force, becomes the natural suspect. Remi defends herself, saying it was impossible to guarantee the calculations given how old [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] is. As soon as she starts to feel cornered by both [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] and [[Jun Lee\|Jun]], she reveals that Jun is planning on leaving the crew anyway. The resulting argument sees Eda interceding, separating them like children. She snaps out at Remi, forbidding her from using their familiar nickname. Silently, they head back to safety.

#### Chapter 3 part 2
With Jun's capture, the insider delivering information about the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] expedition goes silent, leading them to meet with him in person. Under a guise of secrecy, a chip is handed over. Shortly after, the informant was revealed to be none other than [[Richard Mers III\|Richard Mers III]], the current chairman of [[Ironwind\|Ironwind]]. As soon as it's installed into [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], a destination appears. 

Approaching the mysterious lumen cave reveals a colossal debris field. Slipping through it, [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] briefs [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] on the time limits he has. Doubt from her previous "mistake" is clearly still present, but Remi remains serious and Jun decides to trust her. 

As Jun explores the new cave, he realizes quickly that this is completely different from the caves before this. Here, we learn that the gods of [[Myrian Civilization\|Myrian Civilization]] were wiped out by [[Myria Ignis\|Ignis]] for their own hubris. [[Myria Helius\|Helius]] himself admits that he could not control Ignis as he thought he might be able to, and now the entire civilization is paying the price. Standing at what appears to be a throne room, Jun witnesses a lumen memory of their final moments before the gods are all wiped out by a massive flash of light. 

As [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] begins to head back, the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] fleet appears and begins to blast through the debris field. With them so close to [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] is forced to evade missiles and debris before finally shutting down the ship entirely so they aren't destroyed. [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] wakes up and desperately asks Remi what happened to [[Jun Lee\|Jun]]. Remi cracks under the pressure and finally reveals why she hates Jun so much. All this time, her self hatred has been compounding over and over. The more she hates Jun the more she hates herself, and the more Eda likes Jun the less she can do about those feelings. She shouts out "Why do you make me hate myself so much?!" Eda, finally understanding how much she's been neglecting Remi, sees her own self-doubt. She finally reconnects with her sister and the two hug and she promises again to never leave Remi alone with herself. They share a final, heartfelt moment, before they return to the problem at hand.

[[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] enters the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]. Searching for [[Jun Lee\|Jun]], she eventually finds him buried beneath a pile of rubble. Jun, only partially awake, manages to play the same [[Starsong\|Starsong]] [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] made for him when they first met. She uses that to find him. When it becomes clear they need help, she tries to get [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] to fly the [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] in. Remi, realizing that would mean instant destruction by the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] fleet, instead contacts [[Richard Mers III\|Benzel]] to make an emergency connection to [[Bones\|Bones]]. Bones flies his own ship in the fleet into the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]], saving Jun.

Jun awakens to [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] apologizing to him before returning to her usual abrasive self. [[Bones\|Bones]] walks in, commenting on how lucky he seems to be. Jun makes a full recovery as the crew waits out the time their pilots' license is suspended for intruding in [[United Mining\|United Mining]] airspace again. After a month passes, [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] receives an SOS signal from somewhere deep in space.

When the crew locates the SOS signal, it turns out to be a survivor from the nearby [[Excidium\|Excidium]] observation center. He rants about a "voice in the dark", and a monster that came out of nowhere before falling asleep. [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] decides to head to the observation center to see what he's talking about.

Exploring the observation center reveals the "monster" to be none other than a massive [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]] that flew around the system as a comet. When they convert the last observed frequency to sound, a monstrous [[Starsong\|Starsong]] is played. Eda immediately suspects it to be [[Banshee\|Banshee]]. Sharing the news with [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]], both girls are overjoyed that they finally found the cave. While they're celebrating, a message comes in, addressed to the whole crew. [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] reads it only to find that it's a request from his clan for him to return home. The clan is at risk of collapse without him, as they have lost all remaining wealth while he's been gone. Jun mentions it to the rest of the crew, but says he'll think about it later.
#### Chapter 4
The crew race to catch up to it before it flies out of range again. After a harrowing approach that involves dodging the chunks of rock flying behind the comet, they begin exploring [[Banshee\|Banshee]]. The find an old lumen hunting vessel, but none of the crew members.

Oh my god they're holding hands.

As they descend into the shrine, [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] finally notices the God that stands at the center of the shrine. Where before it was always [[Myria Terra\|Terra]], [[Myria Helius\|Helius]] or [[Myria Ignis\|Ignis]], now it's [[Excidium\|Excidium]]. It's quickly revealed that this shrine is actually a trap for those seeking Terra's place of burial. As soon as they discover it, the lumenide begins to rise, threatening to kill both. They manage to make it out of the cave by blowing up the elevator mechanism, causing them to rocket to the surface of the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]. Eda manages to carry the unconscious [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] back to [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], and they make it outside of [[Banshee\|Banshee]] once more.

Once Jun wakes up, [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] reveals that there were actually twin comets -- hinted at while we were grabbing [[Banshee\|Banshee]]'s [[Starsong\|Starsong]] -- and that second comet is currently coming into range for the first time in the next 66 years. This is where the second lumen seeking vessel on the expedition departed to, and presumably why they didn't find [[Red Grant\|Red]]'s body on this one. When calculating the amount of fuel though, they realize there's no way to reach the comet and still have enough fuel to return to the [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]] system. They refer to this second comet as [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]]. When they look at all the facts, [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] decides to part ways with Jun. By sending the escape pod back home, she gives him the chance to save his clan, while still heading to [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]] to find her master.

[[Jun Lee\|Jun]] does not like this. Not at all. As [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] starts making plans, [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] also pleads with her to give up this quest. With both of them against her, Eda finally starts to see reason. She acknowledges the danger and, against her own will, finally backs down. The group agrees to return to [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]] and attempt [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]] when it comes back around.

And then [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] explodes. As they leave [[Banshee\|Banshee]], the ship is hit by debris, causing an engine to detonate. While trying to get the resulting fires under control, [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] and [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] end up in the cargo bay. Still in the bridge, [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] realizes there's nothing more she can do for them. In the end, there was only ever one answer. Eda's quest was always going to drag down everyone around her. She was a danger to herself and everyone she loved. Regardless of her intent, she always hurt the people closest to her. First [[Red Grant\|Red]], then [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]], and now [[Jun Lee\|Jun]]. As the ship deteriorates, she decides to finally take that same step her master did: she sacrifices her life for that of her family. In that moment, Eda becomes the protector she always hated. 

Over the intercom, she directs [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] to take the unconscious [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] to the cargo bay so she can vent all oxygen from the ship and starve the fire. While they wait, she suggests he look through the seeds the ship has always carried. He does, and finds various plants clearly meant to represent each of them. Then he finds the plant [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] is named after. The Fragrant White... with a simple floriography. As Jun realizes it, he understands suddenly what Eda intends to do.

"Please forgive me." Eda says it as the cargo bay ejects from the ship, charting a path back towards [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]] and safety. Eda, now released from her duty as captain, sets course for [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]].
#### Chapter 5
Jun and Remi return to [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]]. They would keep searching for [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]], but never found it. Most of the residents of [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]] disappeared when the second [[Lumen War\|Lumen War]] began. [[Doctor Rushell\|Doctor Rushell]] and [[Bones\|Bones]] are never heard from again. Eventually, the time to return to [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]] came. [[Jun Lee\|Jun]], now an old man, returns to the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]. He finds [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] there in the form of a Lumen wisp. Following it, he discovers the field of flowers the grew around the crashed [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]]. At last, [[Myria Helius\|Helius]] and [[Myria Terra\|Terra]] are able to reunite, when the flowers are always in full bloom.

It's here that we learn how Eda got her name and the meaning behind it: It's a flower that was used to treat her voice, and was given to her by [[Red Grant\|Red]] when she was adopted. By now it's becoming obvious why Eda insisted on coming on this run, and why she wants to get through the gate. She believes Red might be behind it.

Once Jun finishes his work, Eda records a new [[Starsong\|Starsong]]. It's here that she notices huge amount of emotions present in the lumen. Handing the resulting Starsong to Jun, Eda finally apologizes for what happened to Kay. Jun simply brushes it off, saying it wasn't her fault, and continues to activate the gate. When the gate doesn't move, Jun realizes it's actually a ship to activate the entire space station, which resembles a giant Synthesceptor. He pushes Eda out of the way of the blast as he's flung out into space.

Lost in the flow of the Lumen consciousness, Jun remembers how Kay once told him that it was because of him that he stayed with the Lee clan. All at once, his role in Kay's death slams into him. Eda catches up to him and manages to pull him back to the station, but Jun is still devastated by his failure to protect Kay. For him, it's a betrayal of the same traits that Kay admired in him, and the surge of lumen amplified that. Eda assures him that, No, he is not useless. Speaking from her own experience, she reminds him that even if he couldn't save Kay, he did save her from Bones. Without him they couldn't have found this station, and they never would have been able to activate it.

Once Jun calms down, Eda finally reveals that she's been searching for lumen caves in hope of finding her master. Because [[United Mining\|United Mining]] was searching for the mysterious [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]] [[Banshee\|Banshee]], they conscripted her knowing that [[Red Grant\|Red]] would take her place. Ever since then, she and Remi have been searching for [[Banshee\|Banshee]] together. She also explains that this is why she hates when people try to protect her, as it only seems to lead to her losing those people.

Noticing the way the [[Lumen\|lumen]] appears as a sea of flowers, Eda is reminded of her home. She tells [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] about the small house she shared with [[Red Grant\|Red]], where the flower fields are always in full bloom, asking if he wants to see them with her. He seems non-committal at first, but then adds "If it's with you, I would love to see it." Thus begins the promise that will keep the two together for the rest of the game.

There's a short interlude during which it's revealed that the discovery of the Lumen Ziggurat elevated the [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] to a new level of fame. This, combined with the rescue of an [[Ironwind\|Ironwind]] immigration convoy, led to them achieving the title of "Honorable Runners". 

#### Chapter 3 part 1
The story begins with a dream from [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]]. In the dream she remembers hearing a song, but when she tries to sing back six lights stare her down and she loses her voice. Her master tells her she might be experiencing memories from the [[Lumen\|lumen]], and in this case she's right. What Eda is experiencing is the last memories of [[Myria Terra\|Terra]] before the Six Peaks of Earth killed her. 

At this point it's revealed that [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] has been turning down requests for at least a month, but that [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] has continued to overwork herself while hunting down more [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s. Jun says it might be time for them to take a break, given that they've thoroughly satisfied his own need to find [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s. During this conversation, Remi finds information on [[Banshee\|Banshee]], and Eda heads off to find out. Jun starts to work on a message back to his clan leader, saying that he might be returning soon. What he doesn't know is that [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] had to hack into his communications to message Eda, so she sees this as well.

They make their to Mount Aurora, where the [[Lumen Association\|Lumen Association]]'s Council of Ten is waiting to brief them. They ask the members of [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] to infiltrate as many [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]s as they can before [[United Mining\|United Mining]] does. It seems there is a massive push to claim as many of these caves as possible, with one of the caves possibly being [[Banshee\|Banshee]]. Since this is the only lead they've ever gotten on the possible location of [[Red Grant\|Red Grant]], they accept.

Moving into [[Ironwind\|Ironwind]] territory, [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]]'s relationship with [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] begins to go downhill. Because Remi believes Jun is preparing to leave, she starts taking any opportunity she can to jab at him. Despite this, Jun's faith in Remi remains absolute, causing her to spiral into self-hatred. Eventually she uses a cave run as an opportunity to betray Jun. By withholding information at a crucial time, Jun is captured by [[United Mining\|United Mining]] soldiers. Jun quickly realizes he's been betrayed by Remi, but stays silent as the soldiers begin to rough him up. Surprisingly, their captain is none other than [[Bones\|Bones]], and as soon as he sees [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] he orders his men to let him go. He warns him however that this is likely a one-time thing. He won't be able to help again.

When Jun makes it back to [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], they struggle to figure out how Jun got captured. Remi, in charge of the calculations to avoid the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] expedition force, becomes the natural suspect. Remi defends herself, saying it was impossible to guarantee the calculations given how old [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] is. As soon as she starts to feel cornered by both [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] and [[Jun Lee\|Jun]], she reveals that Jun is planning on leaving the crew anyway. The resulting argument sees Eda interceding, separating them like children. She snaps out at Remi, forbidding her from using their familiar nickname. Silently, they head back to safety.

#### Chapter 3 part 2
With Jun's capture, the insider delivering information about the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] expedition goes silent, leading them to meet with him in person. Under a guise of secrecy, a chip is handed over. Shortly after, the informant was revealed to be none other than [[Richard Mers III\|Richard Mers III]], the current chairman of [[Ironwind\|Ironwind]]. As soon as it's installed into [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], a destination appears. 

Approaching the mysterious lumen cave reveals a colossal debris field. Slipping through it, [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] briefs [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] on the time limits he has. Doubt from her previous "mistake" is clearly still present, but Remi remains serious and Jun decides to trust her. 

As Jun explores the new cave, he realizes quickly that this is completely different from the caves before this. Here, we learn that the gods of [[Myrian Civilization\|Myrian Civilization]] were wiped out by [[Myria Ignis\|Ignis]] for their own hubris. [[Myria Helius\|Helius]] himself admits that he could not control Ignis as he thought he might be able to, and now the entire civilization is paying the price. Standing at what appears to be a throne room, Jun witnesses a lumen memory of their final moments before the gods are all wiped out by a massive flash of light. 

As [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] begins to head back, the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] fleet appears and begins to blast through the debris field. With them so close to [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] is forced to evade missiles and debris before finally shutting down the ship entirely so they aren't destroyed. [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] wakes up and desperately asks Remi what happened to [[Jun Lee\|Jun]]. Remi cracks under the pressure and finally reveals why she hates Jun so much. All this time, her self hatred has been compounding over and over. The more she hates Jun the more she hates herself, and the more Eda likes Jun the less she can do about those feelings. She shouts out "Why do you make me hate myself so much?!" Eda, finally understanding how much she's been neglecting Remi, sees her own self-doubt. She finally reconnects with her sister and the two hug and she promises again to never leave Remi alone with herself. They share a final, heartfelt moment, before they return to the problem at hand.

[[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] enters the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]. Searching for [[Jun Lee\|Jun]], she eventually finds him buried beneath a pile of rubble. Jun, only partially awake, manages to play the same [[Starsong\|Starsong]] [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] made for him when they first met. She uses that to find him. When it becomes clear they need help, she tries to get [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] to fly the [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] in. Remi, realizing that would mean instant destruction by the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] fleet, instead contacts [[Richard Mers III\|Benzel]] to make an emergency connection to [[Bones\|Bones]]. Bones flies his own ship in the fleet into the [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]], saving Jun.

Jun awakens to [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] apologizing to him before returning to her usual abrasive self. [[Bones\|Bones]] walks in, commenting on how lucky he seems to be. Jun makes a full recovery as the crew waits out the time their pilots' license is suspended for intruding in [[United Mining\|United Mining]] airspace again. After a month passes, [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]] receives an SOS signal from somewhere deep in space.

When the crew locates the SOS signal, it turns out to be a survivor from the nearby [[Excidium\|Excidium]] observation center. He rants about a "voice in the dark", and a monster that came out of nowhere before falling asleep. [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] decides to head to the observation center to see what he's talking about.

Exploring the observation center reveals the "monster" to be none other than a massive [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]] that flew around the system as a comet. When they convert the last observed frequency to sound, a monstrous [[Starsong\|Starsong]] is played. Eda immediately suspects it to be [[Banshee\|Banshee]]. Sharing the news with [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]], both girls are overjoyed that they finally found the cave. While they're celebrating, a message comes in, addressed to the whole crew. [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] reads it only to find that it's a request from his clan for him to return home. The clan is at risk of collapse without him, as they have lost all remaining wealth while he's been gone. Jun declines to mention it to the rest of the crew.
#### Chapter 4
The crew race to catch up to it before it flies out of range again. After a harrowing approach that involves dodging the chunks of rock flying behind the comet, they begin exploring [[Banshee\|Banshee]]. The find an old lumen hunting vessel, but none of the crew members.

Oh my god they're holding hands.

As they descend into the shrine, [Eda](app://obsidian.md/Edalune%20Grant) finally notices the God that stands at the center of the shrine. Where before it was always [Terra](app://obsidian.md/Myria%20Terra), [Helius](app://obsidian.md/Myria%20Helius) or [Ignis](app://obsidian.md/Myria%20Ignis), now it's [Excidium](app://obsidian.md/Excidium). It's quickly revealed that this shrine is actually a trap for those seeking Terra's place of burial. As soon as they discover it, the lumenide begins to rise, threatening to kill both. They manage to make it out of the cave by blowing up the elevator mechanism, causing them to rocket to the surface of the [lumen cave](app://obsidian.md/Lumen%20Caves). Eda manages to carry the unconscious [Jun](app://obsidian.md/Jun%20Lee) back to [[Red Chamber\|Red Chamber]], and they make it outside of [[Banshee\|Banshee]] once more.

Once Jun wakes up, [Remi](app://obsidian.md/Remi%20Dorian) reveals that there were actually twin comets -- hinted at while we were grabbing [Banshee](app://obsidian.md/Banshee)'s [Starsong](app://obsidian.md/Starsong) -- and that second comet is currently coming into range for the first time in the next 66 years. This is where the second lumen seeking vessel on the expedition departed to, and presumably why they didn't find [Red](app://obsidian.md/Red%20Grant)'s body on this one. When calculating the amount of fuel though, they realize there's no way to reach the comet and still have enough fuel to return to the [Thousand Peaks](app://obsidian.md/Thousand%20Peaks) system. They refer to this second comet as [Phoenix](app://obsidian.md/Phoenix). When they look at all the facts, [Eda](app://obsidian.md/Edalune%20Grant) decides to part ways with Jun. By sending the escape pod back home, she gives him the chance to save his clan, while still heading to [Phoenix](app://obsidian.md/Phoenix) to find her master.

[Jun](app://obsidian.md/Jun%20Lee) does not like this. Not at all. As [Eda](app://obsidian.md/Edalune%20Grant) starts making plans, [Remi](app://obsidian.md/Remi%20Dorian) also pleads with her to give up this quest. With both of them against her, Eda finally starts to see reason. She acknowledges the danger and, against her own will, finally backs down. The group agrees to return to [Thousand Peaks](app://obsidian.md/Thousand%20Peaks) and attempt [Phoenix](app://obsidian.md/Phoenix) when it comes back around.

And then [Red Chamber](app://obsidian.md/Red%20Chamber) explodes. As they leave [Banshee](app://obsidian.md/Banshee), the ship is hit by debris, causing an engine to detonate. While trying to get the resulting fires under control, [Remi](app://obsidian.md/Remi%20Dorian) and [Jun](app://obsidian.md/Jun%20Lee) end up in the cargo bay. Still in the bridge, [Eda](app://obsidian.md/Edalune%20Grant) realizes there's nothing more she can do for them. In the end, there was only ever one answer. Eda's quest was always going to drag down everyone around her. She was a danger to herself and everyone she loved. Regardless of her intent, she always hurt the people closest to her. First [Red](app://obsidian.md/Red%20Grant), then [Remi](app://obsidian.md/Remi%20Dorian), and now [Jun](app://obsidian.md/Jun%20Lee). As the ship deteriorates, she decides to finally take that same step her master did: she sacrifices her life for that of her family. In that moment, Eda becomes the protector she always hated.

Over the intercom, she directs [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] to take the unconscious [[Remi Dorian\|Remi]] to the cargo bay so she can vent all oxygen from the ship and starve the fire. While they wait, she suggests he look through the seeds the ship has always carried. He does, and finds various plants clearly meant to represent each of them. Then he finds the plant [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] is named after. The Fragrant White... with a simple floriography. As Jun realizes it, he understands suddenly what Eda intends to do.

"Please forgive me." Eda says it as the cargo bay ejects from the ship, charting a path back towards [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]] and safety. Eda, now released from her duty as captain, sets course for [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]].
#### Chapter 5
Jun and Remi return to [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]]. They would keep searching for [[Phoenix\|Phoenix]], but never found it.
