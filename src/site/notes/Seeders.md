Memory mages that can create and plant new memories. These memories are weak at first, but if they aren't noticed by the target they will grow and take root. Seeders tend to be very creative by necessity, and they require a lot of knowledge about their target to do their work. In most cases a weak seed causes inconsistencies in the target's mind, and the brain will notice and correct these inconsistencies quickly, preventing seeds from taking root. To prevent this, seeders look for memories that the target is already uncertain about. By presenting plausible realities in these doubts seeders can rewrite how the target remembers reality. Because of how memories affect reality this can cause an actual reality shift, but something on that scale requires a lot of work across a lot of people. Seeders also benefit greatly from the assistance of [[Takers\|Takers]], who can create doubts at will by depriving the target of specific memories.
