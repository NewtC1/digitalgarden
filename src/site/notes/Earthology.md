#OPUS #RocketOfWhispers #TheDayWeFoundEarth
Earthology is the worship of the original Earth. In the world it was founded, the humanity has spread far afield from their original home. This has resulted in the loss of the original Earth's location, leading to its mythologization. The first game in the OPUS series, [[The Day we Found Earth\|The Day we Found Earth]], is centered on the work that was being done to rediscover Earth's location.

Heads of the Earthology Church are referred to as witches, something that's expanded on in [[Rocket of Whispers\|Rocket of Whispers]]. These witches frequently use the ritual phrase "Heavenly Earth, may you return to the cosmos"(check?) to refer to the act of returning to the dead to the stars above whatever planet they are on. As of the events of Rocket of Whispers, there are only 12 witches.

While they share a name, the witches in [[Echo of Starsong\|Echo of Starsong]] are a different religion, notably  that of the [[Myrian Witching Tower\|Myrian Witching Tower]], also known as [[Myria Terra\|Myria Terra]].
