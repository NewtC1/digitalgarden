## Arcs
Kay is a former veteran of the [[Lumen War\|Lumen War]], and as a result has a lot of experience under his belt. His previous master was slain during the war, likely a result of the power struggles within [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]]. Kay is thoroughly fed up with the political games, and is on the verge of leaving [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]]entirely when he meets a young [[Jun Lee\|Jun]]. Jun displays morals that Kay respects deeply -- the desire to protect others from suffering. It doesn't take long for Kay to start working for the Lee clan as Jun's guardian.

After [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] is cast out, Kay follows him to [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]]. Unfortunately, during their first run in a [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]], they run afoul of the [[Bones Brigade\|Bones Brigade]], who shoots Kay as he's trying to protect Jun. They escape, but Kay is wounded. While trying to find a lumen plant in another cave, Kay realizes that the bounty placed on [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] has likely attracted the attention of the [[East Ocean\|East Ocean]]ers. This is confirmed when they find an East Ocean medallion on the path into the cave. Understanding what this means, Kay stays behind and drives off the assassin. Unfortunately, he's mortally wounded in the process.

As he was dying, Kay reminds Jun to always uphold the morals he admired so much. His last words are to remind Jun that the "Lee clan must never cry."

Kay doesn't have much an arc, but his meaning to [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] never goes away throughout the story. We're still seeing flashbacks with him as the focus near the end of the game.
