#OPUS #TheDayWeFoundEarth 

### Notable Characters
#### Leads
- [[Emeth\|Emeth]]
- [[Lisa\|Lisa]]
#### Side
- [[Makoto\|Makoto]]
- [[John\|John]]
### Summary
A small robot named [[Emeth\|Emeth]] searches for Earth, with only the AI duplicate of his creator, [[Lisa\|Lisa]] to keep him company.

Story begins with Emeth being awoken for an unknown reason, likely due to increasing solar energy in the telescope.
Over time more of the ship unlocks and [[Lisa\|Lisa]] is activated. She helps Emeth search for Earth, unlocking more of the telescopes features as she does.
Emeth grows increasingly nervous about the fate of his creator, drawing a connection to her fate and his search for Earth. 
Upon unlocking the bedroom, it's revealed that the ship was damaged by a solar flare near its expected return date.
He eventually pressures Lisa into risking herself to unlock later areas of the ship. Doing so reveals that something may have happened to Lisa, and that she may  not be alive anymore. It's also mentioned the ship has likely been offline for over 400 years. Exploring further causes the [[Lisa\|Lisa]] AI to be flagged by the ship as an intruder, and damages OPUS permanently. Exploring the docking port, Emeth finds out that the escape pod was launched. An ominous message indicates that Lisa was likely sick with an unknown illness and had to be sent home. Her assistant, [[Makoto\|Makoto]], is nowhere to be found. Emeth is left to find the last few Earth candidates on his own. As the OPUS runs out of power, the little robot races to finish the last few searches. 

### Questions
- Why was Emeth made with a child personality?
- How did Earth become lost to begin with?
- What does the Earthology cult stand for?
- How concrete is an identity? Can it represent numerous things.
### Notes
- When the game begins, the crew of the OPUS had already searched at least one galaxy for Earth, possibly more
- The stated reason for searching for Earth is because humanity's gene pool has degraded due to genetic engineering. They need to locate the original source to rectify this.
- This game takes place tens of thousands of years later, after humanity has spread out amongst the stars.
- There is some suggestion that humans might be a the result of genetic engineering if they can't find Earth.
- It looks like Emeth was reactivated because the telescope was getting closer to LISA the star.
	- The ship was hidden from the sun because it was orbiting on the dark side of a satellite from Lisa. By the time the ship is reactivated, 400 years have passed.
- There's a lot of notes about how no one except [[Lisa\|Lisa]] believed in the existence of Earth.
- DLC content
	- A Gift for Emeth - Short scavenger hunt to get a small drawing
		- The quotes are all references to things people said in relation to seeing the Earth from space.
	- Introduction to cosmic myths
		- Emeth and Lisa look for cosmic bodies corresponding to existing cosmic myths 
		- Flame wheel - Ignis?
		- Black hole where the civilization fought a massive battle
		- Eye of the Minotaur, a massive shipyard
		- This DLC mostly highlights that humanity has been around for a very, very long time.
	- Celestial Dream
		- Lisa gets controlled by an entity taking the form of a young boy named John. He hijacks the AI to force Emeth to find a planet for him.
		- John talks about seeing a blue dot through a telescope, which he bragged to his friend about. He's using Emeth to confirm this brag.
		- The DLC ends with him falling asleep and Emeth getting a taste of his own medicine.
		- Small reference to Starsongs here ![Pasted image 20251023202615.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020251023202615.png)
		- Also talks about quantum entities projecting their memories, much like the gods in EoS ![Pasted image 20251023202649.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020251023202649.png)
	- Faraway Home
		- Emeth and Lisa intercept a casket with a dead body that's been sent towards its home.
		- As they search for the man's original destination, assumed to be his home, it's revealed he was part of a nuclear war and that his home may have been destroyed long ago.
		- Lisa has trouble explaining the concept of a war to Emeth.
		- The story ends when they discover the planet has long since recovered from the war and is blossoming again.
		- While Lisa is trying to explain the idea of cosmic recurrence to Emeth, she says this. This becomes a running theme with the series, that our souls return to the stars upon death. Possibly this this an [[Earthology\|Earthology]] belief? ![Pasted image 20251023204148.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020251023204148.png)
	- [[Makoto\|Makoto]]'s Notes
		- Emeth finds a series of constellations that Makoto drew on his own
		- Tracking down the constellations leads to the revelation of Makoto's wife, Ida. It's suggested that Makoto eventually found his way back to her, though there's some hint that it's because both of them are dead now.
	- [[Makoto\|Makoto]]'s Task
		- Emeth finds code to activate a second AI, which is revealed to be a copy of Makoto.
		- This version of Makoto, created before Emeth's creation, is searching for solar megastructures - Dyson Spheres.
		- Makoto is very curt and immediately recruits both Lisa and Emeth into his search. After a few failed candidates, they succeed in finding evidence of a Dyson Sphere.
		- Some indication that Lisa was not supposed to put an AI on a robot. ![Pasted image 20251023211100.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020251023211100.png)
		- When asked, Lisa reveals she went with a child personality because of the need for a different perspective.
		- "Never a moment wasted."
- This game is intended as a re-enactment of the Grand Work of alchemy, with the player recreating the Kabbalic Tree of Life over the course of their searches. All the different Sephirot are present in different sections, and the number of sections numbers 22, the same number as the links in the Tree of Life. This ties back into the name of the game, OPUS, which is based on the Magnum Opus in alchemy.
### Themes
- Fulfilling the Doctor's dream
- Reuniting after death
