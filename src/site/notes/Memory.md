#theme #universal

Commonly paired with identity, memories are a core part of what we think of as ourselves. Many people take memories for granted, which makes this a difficult universal to work with. This gets more effective with an audience who either has a large number of memories or has experienced significant memory loss.

Interestingly, memories are frequently paired with an element of mistrust. They are so frequently taken for granted that calling attention to them makes them seem untrustworthy. Many stories that use them play with this idea.

One of the limitations of memory stories is that even if characters lose their memories, the audience does not. This needs to be taken into account, but there are clever ways to play with this, mostly by hiding core memories from audience until it becomes relevant.
