* Four types of memory magic, with dedicated casters to each
	* [[Changers\|Changers]]
	* [[Watchers\|Watchers]]
	* [[Takers\|Takers]]
	* [[Seeders\|Seeders]]
* Individual casters can get more specialized as they grow
* Humans aren't the only casters. Certain animals can also use memory magic, and may have developed it as a defense mechanism.
* Reality is shaped by how people remember it. If enough memory mages of a different type work together, they can completely alter reality.
* Magic is innate, but the ability to use it is a result of mental necessity.
	* A coping mechanism??
* How to activate magic is unknown.
* Governments know about magic, and make use of it to some degree.
* Most mages would prefer not to work with the government, as it's not a position of respect and many mages are even shunned, depending on the government they work for.
* The general populace definitely does not know about magic and governments and memory mages do what they can to keep it that way.
	* Both have a vested interest in staying hidden.
	* Possible the governments each think others don't know about magic?
* Groups of mages will frequently stick together for safety, but do not trust each other due to the nature of their magic.
	* There isn't an official name for these groups, as they generally form out of necessity rather than intention.
	* Possible nation of mages?
