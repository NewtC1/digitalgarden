#EchoOfStarsong #OPUS 
This is the civilization that was built before the event of [[Echo of Starsong\|Echo of Starsong]]. Like the current civilization, they used [[Lumen\|Lumen]], though it seems they didn't use it in the same way. The Myrians consisted of various deities that were referred to by the names of celestial bodies. The history of the Myrians is retold  throughout  the game in various murals. 

It seems that the gods in the myths were once real people, and that [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] and [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] are re-enacting the events of the that history again in some way, with Eda standing in for [[Myria Terra\|Myria Terra]] and Jun standing in for [[Myria Helius\|Myria Helius]].

At least two of the Myrian gods refer to actual celestial bodies - Ignis is the sun at the center of [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]], and [[Excidium\|Excidium]] is the black hole near the edge of the solar system. The planets also represent individual gods. At some point [[Thousand Peaks\|Thousand Peaks]] had six more planets, but these planets disappeared after they rebelled against [[Myria Helius\|Helius]] in favor of [[Myria Ignis\|Ignis]].

Other than [[Myria Ignis\|Ignis]], most Myrian gods seem to have had a humanoid form. Later in the game it's mentioned that they might have been a combination of [[Lumen\|lumen]] and other minerals. They used song to activate their internal lumen to survive. Without it, they were would turn back into their mineral form. We actually see this mineral later in the game as a sellable item.

+ 2 Orbis, 5 Circum, 14 Gradus

+ This mural shows how [[Myria Helius|Helius]] hoped to use lumen to fuel his empire. Lumen would enter [[Thousand Peaks]] from the two [[Binarii]] gates. The caves containing the [[Lumen|lumen]] would then fly towards [[Myria Ignis|Ignis]], feeding it. ![Pasted image 20251111083557.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020251111083557.png)
