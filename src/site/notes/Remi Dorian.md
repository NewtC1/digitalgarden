## Arcs
Remi's story started after she was orphaned. Growing up on the streets, she was taken advantage of by a child trafficker named Toran. After Toran was busted for smuggling lumen plants, she took the name Remi Dorian, after a chocolate bar that was given to her by some [[United Mining\|United Mining]] soldiers investigating him. She began to work for herself by forging documents and smuggling. 

It was only after being taken in by [[Red Grant\|Red]] that Remi found the security to start working through her feelings. She was able to admit to herself that, as bad of a person as Toran was, she did still like him. He helped her to distract herself from the things she didn't like about herself. Now, she has nothing to do that. When [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] realizes this she offers to become Remi's new Toran. She asks Remi to give her a nickname so they can be a little closer and promises to always be there for Remi until they can some day accept who they are together.

As Eda gets closer to Jun, Remi feels the distance between her and Eda widening. She starts to remember the things she was trying to hide from herself. The memories of Toran return, and her own selfish tendencies surface more often. When it appears that Jun might take Eda with him when he leaves, she goes to drastic lengths. Jun is denied key information during a run and is captured by [[United Mining\|United Mining]].

Remi, stewing in her own self hatred, is spurned by Eda until they reach the next big [[Lumen Caves\|lumen cave]]. During this, she's forced to once again cut communications with [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] when the [[United Mining\|United Mining]] fleet begins to forcefully blast through the debris field. Under intense pressure from [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]], she finally cracks. While before she was hiding her real reason for hating Jun, she at last says it out loud. She speaks from her heart about how abandoned she's felt. She blames Eda for not keeping her promise to help her and be there for her. She makes it clear that she doesn't WANT to hate Jun, but she feels like she has no choice. She doesn't know how to handle these feelings. With all of this out in the open, the two are able to make up. The next time she sees Jun, she's able to sincerely apologize to him.

Remi is about those feelings we don't know how to deal with. Growing up she was always told her eyes were strange, she betrayed her boss, she's not girly enough. These things were internalized, and to some degree she started to think of them as normal. She hated these things about herself, but couldn't do anything about them. It's only when she met [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]] that she had a way to work through those problems. They were never truly solved though, so when [[Jun Lee\|Jun]] entered the picture they resurfaced. She knows she shouldn't hate him. She knows it's irrational, but knowing won't stop these kinds of feelings. She treated them as normal instead, and when no one addressed them they festered and grew worse over time. When it appeared that Jun might take away Eda, the best thing in her life, Remi directed all of that hatred at him to avoid hurting herself. It backfired and pushed Eda even further away. It's only when she was true to herself and admitted how much she doesn't want to feel like this that she was able to really connect with Eda again. By speaking plainly, she finally addresses the problem, and Eda realizes how much she'd been neglecting Remi.

## Themes
- [[Loneliness\|Loneliness]]
	- Being alone is deafening to Remi. Eda's presence helps her to get around this.
- [[Identity\|Identity]]
	- Remi has trouble finding an identity of her own. Due to her upbringing she was never given the time to figure out who she was, and the traits that defined her were hated by others.
- [[Self-hatred\|Self-hatred]]
	- Remi hates that she likes Toran, and it's one of many things she doesn't like about herself. Hiding from that self hatred is what binds her to [[Edalune Grant\|Eda]]
