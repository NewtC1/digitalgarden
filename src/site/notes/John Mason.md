## Arcs
John's arc is about not wanting to say goodbye. While he is tormented by the ghosts, he keeps blaming them for his problems. Eventually it's revealed that the ghosts haunting him are actually his parents, and that he never wanted to send them off in the first place. Subconsciously he started to invent reasons to avoid the space burials - danger, launch failures, fear. All of this is just excuses to avoid saying goodbye to the final memories of his parents. Not acknowledging that they're dead allows him to avoid moving on. John even blames Fei for a lot of this, as she keeps trying to push for the [[Space Burial\|Space Burial]]s even though he doesn't want them to happen.

Complicating all of this is that John has repressed the memories of his family, so he can't recognize the ghosts as his parents. This is slowly picked apart as he ventures into Hetmis City, and then again as he climbs Sacred Mountain while looking for Fei Lin. 

Just like Fei, he's scared of being left alone, and when he lived out that fear for decades after the plague, he internalized it. He tolerates Fei entirely because it soothes that fear, and he doesn't even recognize it.
