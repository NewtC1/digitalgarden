Space burials are rituals conducted by witches of the [[Earthology\|Earthology]] religion to convey [[ghosts\|ghosts]] to the cosmos, after which they will disperse to the afterlife. It is done by writing out the names of all of the saints of the Earthology religion, then burning the manuscript and placing the ashes in the nose cone of the rocket. Ghosts frequently refer to the rocket as "the Bridge" for some reason.
