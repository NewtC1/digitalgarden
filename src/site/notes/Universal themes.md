Universal themes are the part of a story that connects to the audience. Most of them are vague and cover vast territory. What makes stories interesting is how these universal themes interact with each other. For instance, identity is one of the most common, but is also frequently paired with the theme of memories. You can use this to build a web of themes that speak to a specific type of person.

Remember that universal themes are the core of a story. Everything should wrap back around to them, and if it doesn't then that thread should either be cut entirely or repurposed so that it does.
